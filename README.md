In this Lemoncode Frontend Master exercise, we are going to practice how to deploy our application with Github Pages automatically with a Github Actions pipeline.

If you move to the branch called [_gh-pages_](https://github.com/Alienah/lemoncode-master-module-7-gh-pages-pipeline/tree/gh-pages) you can access to the deployment of this application.
